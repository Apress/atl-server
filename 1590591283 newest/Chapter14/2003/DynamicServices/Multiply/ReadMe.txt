       ATL SERVER : Multiply Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Multiply application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the ATL Server Classes but is also a starting 
point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Multiply application.

    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and

    Application Wizard.
 
Multiply.h
    This file contains your ATL Server request handler class customized based on the 
    options you chose in the the ATL Server Wizard.
