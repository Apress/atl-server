========================================================================

AppWizard has created this dataaccess_app application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the ATL Server Classes but is also a starting 
point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your dataaccess_app application.

    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.
 
dataaccess_app.h
    This file contains your ATL Server request handler class customized based on the 
    options you chose in the the ATL Server Wizard.
 
dataaccess_app.srf
    This file contains a starter SRF (Server Response File) for your application.
    It shows a sample usage of the replacement tag {{Hello}} which is 
    associated with the OnHello method in the Cdataaccess_appHandler class.
