General: 
	* All projects are provided as Visual Studio .NET 2002 and Visual Studio .NET 
2003 projects / solutions. Each directory will have a sub directory indicating either
2002 or 2003. Many projects use the vcdeploy tool that automatically configures IIS. 
You can always manually configure IIS and disable this tool in the project settings.

	* Some chapters don't have code, we have put a directory as a place holder in case
anything comes up.
