Extensibility of ATL Server Web Services
========================================

The following code samples are available for this chapter(*):


To deploy: extract the archive content in some folder, load the application in the 
appropriate (*) Visual Studio and build/deploy/run the applications.

For the first two samples (CustomMarshaling and CustomServerSideParsing), you will need
IIS for the server side application

OverriddenTransport.zip does not need IIS as it is not using HTTP for transport of the 
SOAP payload



\2002\CustomMarshaling.zip -- sample for marshaling a custom type (GUID)
\2002\CustomServerSideParsing.zip -- sample for overriding the parsing on the server side
\2002\OverriddenTransport.zip -- sample for using a different (non-HTTP) transport mechanism






(*) --  the samples are grouped in folders named 2002 and 2003
2002 -- built and tested with Visual Studio .Net 2002
2003 -- built and tested with Visual Studio .Net 2003
